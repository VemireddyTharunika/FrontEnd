    <!-- Block-level container -->
    <div>
      This is a block-level element. Within it, we refer to 
      <span>Tharunika Vemireddy</span> as a highlighted name using an inline element.
    </div>

    <!-- Another block-level structure -->
    <div>
      <span>Tharunika</span> is the first name, and 
      <span>Vemireddy</span> is the last name, both wrapped in inline tags within a block-level container.
